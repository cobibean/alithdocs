## The Problem Landscape

The rapid advancement of AI technologies has illuminated critical challenges within centralized AI ecosystems. Faced with both macro and micro challenges in the age of AI, we cannot afford to stand idly by.

### Macro-Level Challenges in the AI Ecosystem

* **Data Sovereignty and Accessibility**: Centralized platforms often monopolize access to data and resources, creating barriers for small-to-medium developers and limiting innovation.
* **Privacy Concerns**: Users lack control over their data, leading to privacy breaches and unverified data usage.
* **Resource Inefficiency**: Current models struggle with high inference costs, low efficiency, and limitations in accessing non-public data.
* **Limited Decentralization**: Governance models skew toward centralized authorities, resulting in opaque decision-making and inequitable profit distribution.

### Micro-Level Challenges: Usability of Agent Tools

* **Complexity**: Agent tools often demand technical expertise, limiting accessibility for non-developers. Customization options are cumbersome and not intuitive.
* **Performance Bottlenecks**: High computational costs and low responsiveness reduce the efficiency and scalability of current agent frameworks.
* **Fragmentation**: Isolated ecosystems make integration difficult, leading to disjointed workflows and inconsistent user experiences.
* **Lack of Web3 Integration**: Many frameworks fail to leverage blockchain's transparency and interoperability, missing opportunities for innovation in decentralized AI applications.

These problems hinder innovation and limit the participation of developers and developers-to-be from diverse backgrounds in the development of AI technology. This highlights the belief that many ordinary individuals will transition into developers, joining the wave of AI and Web3 innovation.
