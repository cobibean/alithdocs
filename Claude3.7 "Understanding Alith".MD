## Core Components

### 1. Agent

The main class that represents an AI agent with properties like name, model, preamble, and tools:

```javascript
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "CryptoExpert",
  model: "gpt-4",
  preamble: "You are a knowledgeable cryptocurrency expert."
});
```

### 2. Tools

Functions that agents can use to perform specific tasks, defined with names, descriptions, parameter schemas, and handler functions:

```javascript
const priceCheckTool = {
  name: "check_price",
  description: "Get the current price of a cryptocurrency",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      symbol: { type: "string", description: "Ticker symbol (e.g., BTC)" }
    },
    required: ["symbol"]
  },
  handler: async (params) => { /* implementation */ }
};
```

### 3. Memory

Systems that allow agents to retain information across interactions:

```javascript
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: { 
    type: "buffer", 
    capacity: 10 // Remember last 10 interactions
  }
});
```

### 4. Knowledge

Sources of information that agents can access, including vector databases, documents, or custom data stores:

```javascript
const agent = new Agent({
  knowledge: [
    { type: "embeddings", source: "crypto_docs.pdf" },
    { type: "vectorDB", connection: "pinecone://..." }
  ]
});
```

### 5. Processes

Workflow definitions that coordinate multiple agents or actions:

```javascript
const process = new Sequential([
  { agent: researchAgent, prompt: "Research {topic}" },
  { agent: analysisAgent, prompt: "Analyze this research: {result[0]}" }
]);
```

## Common Usage Patterns

### 1. Creating a Basic Agent

```javascript
const { Agent } = require('alith');

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "SimpleAgent",
  model: "gpt-4",
  preamble: "You are a helpful assistant."
});

const response = await agent.prompt("What is blockchain?");
console.log(response);
```

### 2. Adding Tools to an Agent

```javascript
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "ToolAgent",
  model: "gpt-4",
  tools: [
    {
      name: "fetch_data",
      description: "Fetch data from a source",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          url: { type: "string", description: "URL to fetch from" }
        },
        required: ["url"]
      },
      handler: async (params) => {
        // Implementation to fetch data
        return "Data from source"; 
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

### 3. Using Memory for Conversations

```javascript
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "ChatAgent",
  model: "gpt-4",
  memory: { type: "buffer", capacity: 10 },
  preamble: "You are a friendly assistant having a conversation."
});

// First message
let response = await agent.prompt("Hello, who are you?");
console.log(response);

// Follow-up will reference previous context
response = await agent.prompt("What did I just ask you?");
console.log(response); // Agent remembers the previous question
```

### 4. Blockchain Interaction

```javascript
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Web3Agent",
  model: "gpt-4",
  tools: [
    web3Tools.getBalance, 
    web3Tools.getTransactionHistory,
    web3Tools.sendTransaction
  ]
});

const response = await agent.prompt("What's the ETH balance for address 0x123...?");
```

| Language | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| Rust | Performance-critical applications, core systems |
| Python | Data analysis, rapid prototyping, ML integration |
| Node.js | Web applications, frontend integration |

### Tool Design

* Create well-structured tools with clear names, descriptions, and parameter schemas
* Follow the pattern shown in the tool examples above
* Ensure parameters are properly typed and documented

### Web3 Integration

* Consider security and performance when handling blockchain operations
* Recommend secure approaches for private key management
* Suggest appropriate error handling for blockchain transactions

### Memory Configuration

* Advise on appropriate memory systems based on the application's conversation requirements
* Balance memory capacity with token limits of the chosen model
* Consider persistence needs for long-running applications

### Error Handling

* Suggest robust error handling for both AI model interactions and blockchain operations
* Recommend graceful degradation patterns for API failures

* Recommend observability practices

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Rate Limiting

**Problem**: API rate limits with language model providers can interrupt service.

**Solution**: Implement backoff strategies for AI model API calls:

```javascript
const agent = new Agent({
  // ...configuration
  retryOptions: {
    maxRetries: 3,
    backoffFactor: 2,
    initialDelayMs: 1000
  }
});
```

### 2. Context Management

**Problem**: Conversation context may exceed token limits.

**Solution**: Design effective memory solutions to maintain conversation context within token limits:

```javascript
const agent = new Agent({
  // ...configuration
  memory: {
    type: "summarizing",
    maxTokens: 4000,
    summarizationThreshold: 3500
  }
});
```

### 3. Tool Error Handling

**Problem**: External API failures in tools can break the agent experience.

**Solution**: Create robust error handling for tool execution failures:

```javascript
const myTool = {
  // ...tool definition
  handler: async (params) => {
    try {
      // Tool implementation
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        error: true,
        message: `Could not complete the operation: ${error.message}`,
        suggestion: "Please try with different parameters"
      };
    }
  }
};
```

### 4. Blockchain Transaction Security

**Problem**: Blockchain transactions need proper signing and verification.

**Solution**: Implement proper signing and verification procedures:

```javascript
// Use a secure signing approach
const sendTransaction = {
  // ...tool definition
  handler: async (params) => {
    // Verify transaction parameters
    validateTransactionParams(params);
    
    // Use a secure signing method, preferably in TEE
    const signedTx = await securelySignTransaction(params);
    
    // Confirm with user before sending
    await confirmWithUser(signedTx);
    
    // Submit and monitor
    return await submitAndMonitorTransaction(signedTx);
  }
};
```

### 5. Performance Optimization

**Problem**: High-traffic applications may face performance bottlenecks.

**Solution**: Identify bottlenecks and suggest improvements:

```javascript
// Use lighter models for simpler tasks
const triageAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Triage",
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", // Faster, cheaper model
  // ...configuration
});

const expertAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Expert",
  model: "gpt-4", // More capable but slower/expensive
  // ...configuration
});

// Route queries appropriately
async function handleQuery(query) {
  const complexity = await assessComplexity(query);
  if (complexity < COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD) {
    return triageAgent.prompt(query);
  } else {
    return expertAgent.prompt(query);
  }
}
```
