# Cross-Referencing Guide for Alith Documentation

Proper cross-referencing between documentation files helps users navigate the Alith documentation ecosystem more effectively. This guide outlines the standard approach for linking between related content.

## Cross-Reference Types

### 1. "Related Documentation" Section

Each documentation file should include a "Related Documentation" section near the end that links to relevant pages:

```markdown
## Related Documentation

* [Tools](Features/Tools.md) - How to extend agent capabilities with custom functions
* [Memory](Features/Memory.md) - Enabling persistent conversation history
* [Tutorial: Building a Telegram Bot](Tutorials/TelegramBot.md) - See a complete implementation
```

### 2. Inline References

When discussing concepts that are explained in detail elsewhere, use inline links:

```markdown
Alith agents can use [tools](Features/Tools.md) to interact with external systems and [memory](Features/Memory.md) to maintain conversation context.
```

### 3. "See Also" Callouts

For important related content, use callout boxes:

```markdown
> **See Also:** Learn how to implement this feature in a real application in the [Telegram Bot Tutorial](Tutorials/TelegramBot.md).
```

### 4. Code Example References

When showing code that relates to other documentation:

```markdown
```javascript
// This example uses the Memory system documented at Features/Memory.md
const agent = new Agent({
  // ...configuration
  memory: new ConversationMemory({ maxInteractions: 10 })
});
```

## Path Conventions

### Relative Paths

Use relative paths for all documentation links:

- Same directory: `[Link Text](Filename.md)`
- Child directory: `[Link Text](Directory/Filename.md)`
- Parent directory: `[Link Text](../Directory/Filename.md)`

### Section Links

Link to specific sections within a document using Markdown anchors:

```markdown
[Memory Configuration Options](Features/Memory.md#configuration-options)
```

## Cross-Reference Patterns by Document Type

### Feature Documentation

Feature documentation should link to:
- Related features
- Relevant tutorials
- Advanced topics that build on the feature

### Tutorials

Tutorials should link to:
- Feature documentation for concepts used
- Advanced topics for further learning
- Related tutorials for alternative approaches

### Advanced Topics

Advanced documentation should link to:
- Prerequisite features
- Related advanced topics
- Tutorials demonstrating practical implementation

## Cross-Reference Maintenance

When updating documentation:

1. Check incoming links to ensure they're still valid
2. Update outgoing links if referenced content has changed
3. Add cross-references to new related content
4. Remove cross-references to deprecated content

## Examples of Good Cross-Referencing

### In Feature Documentation

```markdown
## Overview

The Alith Memory system allows agents to maintain context across interactions. This is essential for building agents that can have meaningful multi-turn conversations and remember important information.

See the [Memory Configuration Guide](../Advanced/MemoryConfiguration.md) for detailed setup options.

## Usage

```javascript
// Basic memory setup
const { Agent, ConversationMemory } = require('alith');

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'support-agent',
  model: 'gpt-4',
  memory: new ConversationMemory({ maxInteractions: 10 })
});
```

For a complete implementation, see the [Building a Telegram Bot](../Tutorials/TelegramBot.md#adding-memory-to-your-bot) tutorial.
```

### In Tutorials

```markdown
## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you understand:
- [Alith Tools](../Features/Tools.md)
- [Alith Memory](../Features/Memory.md)

## Implementation

We'll create a bot that uses both tools and memory:

```javascript
// Implementation code here
```

See [Advanced Tool Patterns](../Advanced/ToolPatterns.md) for more complex implementations.
