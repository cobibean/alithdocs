## Using AI with Alith

One of the most powerful ways to accelerate your development with Alith is to use AI assistants (like Claude, GPT, or Cursor) to help you build. This documentation is structured to make it easy for AI assistants to understand Alith and provide valuable guidance.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** For comprehensive guidance on working with AI assistants, check out our [AI Assistant Guide](AIAssistantGuide.md).

### How to Use AI with Alith Documentation:

1. **Share the Understanding File**: The [`Claude3.7 "Understanding Alith".MD`](Claude3.7%20"Understanding%20Alith".MD) file provides AI assistants with a concise overview of Alith's core concepts. Share this file at the beginning of your AI assistant conversation for better results.

2. **Follow the AI Assistant Guide**: The [`AIAssistantGuide.md`](AIAssistantGuide.md) provides detailed instructions on how to effectively use AI assistants with Alith, including prompting techniques and example scenarios.

3. **Import the Documentation Directory**: For the best development experience, import the entire `alithdocs` directory into your AI-enhanced code editor:
   
   **For Cursor:**
   - Open your project in Cursor
   - Click "File" > "Open Folder" and select the `alithdocs` directory
   - Alternatively, if working on an Alith project, simply include the `alithdocs` folder in your project root
   - Cursor will automatically index these files and use them as context when you ask for help

   **For Windsurf and other AI Assistants:**
   - Add the `alithdocs` folder to your current workspace
   - When asking questions, explicitly mention that you're working with Alith
   - You can reference specific documentation files: "Using the information in alithdocs/Features/Tools.md, help me..."

4. **Use Documentation References**: When asking for help, reference specific documentation files to get more accurate assistance:
   ```
   Based on alithdocs/Tutorials/TelegramBotWithRAG.md, help me implement document retrieval in my bot.
   ```

5. **Ask for Code Examples**: AI assistants can use their understanding of Alith to generate code examples for your specific use case.

6. **Get Architecture Guidance**: Ask AI to help you design your agent architecture based on the concepts in these documentation files.

7. **Help with Debugging**: When you encounter issues, sharing both your code and the relevant documentation with AI can lead to faster problem resolution.

### Example Questions for AI Assistants

When working with AI assistants on Alith projects, you might ask:

- "How do I create a Telegram bot using Alith that can answer questions about crypto prices?"
- "Show me how to implement memory in my Alith agent so it remembers conversation context"
- "Help me design a Web3 tool that allows my agent to check NFT metadata"
- "What's the best way to structure my agent for a DeFi analysis application?"
- "Debug this error I'm getting with my Alith agent's blockchain integration"
