# Alith Documentation Repository

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the Alith framework - a powerful Web3-friendly AI agent framework designed for building advanced AI applications. The documentation covers everything from basic concepts to advanced implementation techniques across multiple programming languages (Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python).

## Why a Standalone Documentation Repository?

This documentation is maintained as a standalone repository to:

1. **Enhance AI Assistant Integration**: Modern AI-powered development tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude can reference these files to provide more accurate and contextual assistance when building with Alith.

2. **Versioned Documentation**: Maintain specific documentation versions that match Alith releases.

3. **Community Contributions**: Enable direct contributions to documentation without needing to modify the core codebase.

4. **Offline Reference**: Provide a complete offline reference for Alith developers.

## Key Features of This Documentation
